- search_dad_joke.py fetches a random dad joke based on the topic the user inputs when the program is ran.
- random_joke_gui.py  GUI! fetches a random dad joke every time you click the button

<b>I know these programs have a lot of comments! But I post them here for educational purposes and hopefully the extra comments will help people that are learning python better understand the logic I used!</b>

These are very simple programs to practice using APIs in python.
You can make more detailed programs following the icanhazdadjoke.com api documentation here: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api
