# dad-jokes-python
These are multiple python scripts to fetch dad jokes from  icanhazdadjoke.com API.  

- random_dad_joke.py fetches a random dad joke everytime that the script is ran
- search_dad_joke.py fetches a random dad joke based on the topic the user inputs when the program is ran.

These are very simple programs to practice using APIs in python.
You can make more detailed programs following the icanhazdadjoke.com api documentation here: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api
